REMEDIATION CYCLE 1: Developers have applied fixes for the critical/high issues you found.

Re-audit the specific files that were flagged in your previous report at "docs/security-audit.md".
1. Verify each Critical and High issue has been addressed
2. Check that fixes are correct and complete (not just suppressing the issue)
3. Update your security report at "docs/security-audit.md" with the verification results
4. Mark resolved issues as "Resolved" and note any remaining concerns

If all Critical/High issues are resolved, explicitly state "No critical or high-severity issues remaining."
