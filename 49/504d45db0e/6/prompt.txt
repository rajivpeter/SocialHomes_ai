REMEDIATION CYCLE 1: Critical or high-severity security issues have been found.

Read the security audit report at "docs/security-audit.md" carefully. Focus ONLY on fixing the issues marked as "Critical" or "High" severity.

For each issue:
1. Read the finding and understand the vulnerability
2. Locate the affected code (file:line references are in the report)
3. Apply the recommended fix or implement an equivalent secure solution
4. Verify your fix doesn't break existing functionality

Do NOT rebuild the entire project. Only fix the specific security issues.
After fixing, run "npm run build" in the affected directory to verify no build errors.
