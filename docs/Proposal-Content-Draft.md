## PROPOSAL FOR CONSORTIUM-MANAGED HOUSING SOLUTION

**SocialHomes.Ai**
The UK's First AI-Native Housing Management System

Prepared by: Yantra.Works Ltd & 3C
Date: February 2026
Version: 2.0

COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE & CONFIDENTIAL

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SocialHomes.Ai is a purpose-built, AI-native housing management system designed specifically for smaller UK housing associations that are underserved by the current market.

The social housing sector's dominant systems — Civica Cx, NEC Housing, MRI Software — were built before cloud computing and before AI. They are expensive, slow, form-heavy, and designed for large-scale providers. Smaller housing associations managing 1,000 to 20,000 homes are left with two options: overpay for enterprise systems they cannot fully utilise, or rely on ageing, unsupported software and spreadsheets.

SocialHomes.Ai is a ground-up alternative. Built cloud-native on Google Cloud Platform and AI-native from the first line of code, it delivers a modern operating system for housing operations at a fraction of the cost of legacy providers.

**The Proposition:**

- **Consortium Model**: 10 housing associations co-invest in building and owning a housing management system tailored to their collective needs, governed by a joint Board.
- **40% Cost Reduction**: Agentic AI development (using Yantra Framework) reduces build and maintenance costs by 40% compared to traditional software development.
- **Working Prototype**: A fully functional prototype is live at socialhomes.ai, demonstrating the Dashboard, Tenancies, Properties, Repairs, Compliance, Rent & Income, Complaints, AI Centre, and 30+ Reports.
- **Licence in Perpetuity**: Founding consortium members receive a permanent licence for the completed product with the option to self-host at no ongoing cost.
- **Regulatory Ready**: Built with HACT v3.5 data standards, Awaab's Law compliance timers, TSM reporting, and Big 6 safety tracking from the outset — not as bolt-on modules.
- **UK Data Only**: All data held within the UK (Google Cloud, London region). SOC 2 compliant infrastructure with Cloud Armor WAF protection.

**We are seeking 10 housing associations to join the founding consortium for an 18–24 month co-development programme.**

# THE CHALLENGE: WHY THE SECTOR NEEDS A NEW APPROACH

## Legacy Systems Were Not Built for Today's Demands

The UK social housing sector manages over 4.2 million homes. The regulatory, compliance, and operational demands on housing providers have never been greater:

- **Awaab's Law** (2024) introduces legally binding response timescales for damp and mould — Emergency (24 hours), Significant Hazard (days), and Standard responses — with severe penalties for non-compliance.
- **Tenant Satisfaction Measures (TSM)** require providers to collect, report, and benchmark satisfaction data across 22 measures annually.
- **The Building Safety Act** and **Fire Safety Act** have raised the bar for compliance record-keeping and proactive risk management.
- **The Regulator of Social Housing (RSH)** now conducts consumer regulation inspections, with powers to issue Regulatory Notices for poor service.
- **The Housing Ombudsman's Complaint Handling Code** mandates structured Stage 1 and Stage 2 processes with strict timescales.

Yet the systems housing associations use to manage these obligations were designed in the 1990s and 2000s. They are:

**Expensive**: Annual licence fees of £100,000–£300,000+ for mid-size providers, plus implementation costs, plus per-module charges, plus training fees.

**Slow and Form-Heavy**: User interfaces built around data-entry forms, not operational intelligence. Staff spend more time navigating the system than using it.

**Not Cloud-Native**: Most legacy systems are on-premise or partially migrated to cloud. They cannot auto-scale, they require dedicated IT teams, and they lack real-time data processing.

**AI as an Afterthought**: Where AI features exist in legacy systems, they are bolt-ons purchased as separate modules at additional cost. They are not woven into the fabric of everyday operations.

**Not Designed for Smaller Providers**: The same enterprise system sold to a 50,000-home provider is sold to a 3,000-home provider. The complexity, cost, and overhead are disproportionate.

## The Gap in the Market

Smaller housing associations (1,000–20,000 units) face a stark choice:

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Enterprise HMS (Civica, NEC, MRI) | Overpriced, over-engineered, poor value |
| Budget HMS or spreadsheets | Cannot meet regulatory requirements |
| Build your own | Too expensive and risky for a single organisation |

**SocialHomes.Ai addresses this gap directly** — a modern, AI-native system built specifically for this segment of the market, funded and governed by the organisations that use it.

# THE SOLUTION: SOCIALHOMES.AI

## What It Is

SocialHomes.Ai is a comprehensive housing management system that covers the full operational lifecycle:

- Tenancy and resident management
- Property and asset management
- Repairs and maintenance
- Rent collection and arrears management
- Compliance and safety (Big 6 + Awaab's Law)
- Complaints handling (Housing Ombudsman Code)
- Allocations and lettings
- Anti-social behaviour case management
- Communications and correspondence
- Reporting and regulatory returns (30+ reports)
- AI-powered intelligence, predictions, and automation

It is:
- **Cloud-native** — runs on Google Cloud Platform (London region), auto-scales, zero-downtime deployments
- **AI-native** — 8 AI prediction models woven into every screen, not bolted on as modules
- **HACT v3.5 compliant** — built on the UK Housing Data Standard from the data model up
- **Persona-scoped** — 5 user personas (COO to Operative) each see data scoped to their responsibility

## The Consortium Model

Rather than one organisation bearing the full cost and risk of building a modern HMS, SocialHomes.Ai is built by a consortium of 10 housing associations working in partnership:

- **Joint Governance**: A Board chaired by a Housing CEO, with standing members from Yantra.Works and 3C, sets priorities and the roadmap.
- **Shared Investment**: Each member organisation contributes nominally to the build in instalments, spreading the cost across the consortium.
- **Collective Input**: Member organisations agree on standardised processes (SOPs) and work together to ensure the system meets collective needs.
- **Perpetual Licence**: Founding members receive a licence in perpetuity for the product built at the end of the pilot period.
- **Self-Hosting Option**: The completed system can be self-managed and hosted by each organisation at no additional cost. Full documentation is provided. Paid hosting and support is available at a discounted rate for the first three years.
- **IP Ownership**: Intellectual property is held by Yantra.Works, with the codebase accessible to all members indefinitely via GitHub for assurance.
- **Open to Growth**: Once the platform succeeds beyond the founding group, all members benefit from continued development funded by paying organisations — without additional capital outlay.

## How It Is Built

SocialHomes.Ai uses **agentic AI development** powered by the Yantra Framework. This means:

- AI agents assist in writing, testing, and maintaining code under the supervision of experienced engineers
- Build and maintenance costs are reduced by approximately **40%** compared to traditional software development
- All work is supervised, quality assured, and security assured by experienced engineers
- Development velocity is significantly higher than conventional teams, allowing rapid iteration based on consortium feedback

# AI INTELLIGENCE: 8 MODELS, NOT A BOLT-ON

## What Makes SocialHomes.Ai Different

Legacy housing systems treat AI as an optional module — an additional product you purchase and configure separately. In SocialHomes.Ai, AI is woven into the interface itself. Every page has a standard zone (fixed fields, buttons, navigation) and an **AI Dynamic zone** that changes based on the entity being viewed, the user's role, external data, and predictive models.

This means housing officers don't go to a separate "AI module" — intelligence comes to them, on every screen, in context.

## The 8 AI Models

| # | Model | What It Does | Example |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Arrears Trajectory Prediction** | Predicts which tenants are likely to enter or increase arrears within 30–90 days | "5 tenancies predicted to enter arrears. Primary factors: UC transition (3), seasonal pattern (1), employment change indicator (1)" |
| 2 | **Complaint Escalation Prediction** | Identifies cases at risk of formal complaint or Housing Ombudsman escalation | "Mrs Chen: 72% probability of formal complaint within 14 days. Waiting 47 days for repair REP-2025-04521. Estimated compensation liability: £150–£300" |
| 3 | **Damp & Mould Risk Scoring** | Combines weather forecasts, building profiles, and history to predict damp risk | "Heavy rain forecast Thursday–Friday. Combined with building profiles (1960s concrete, north-facing), 4 properties at high risk of new damp reports" |
| 4 | **Silent Tenant Welfare Alerts** | Flags vulnerable tenants with no recent contact | "3 tenants with vulnerability flags have had no contact in 6+ months. All elderly. Recommend welfare check visits" |
| 5 | **Arrears Risk Prioritisation** | Ranks the arrears worklist by risk score and recommends specific next actions | "Mrs Walker: £1,456 arrears, Risk Score 98, UC Claiming. Recommended action: Contact UC helpline" |
| 6 | **Recurring Repair Pattern Analysis** | Detects patterns in repair history that suggest capital works are more cost-effective | "Oak Tower: 12 plumbing repairs in 12 months across 8 units. Pattern suggests ageing copper pipework. Proactive replacement: £18,000. Continued responsive cost projected: £12,000/year" |
| 7 | **TSM Improvement Opportunity** | Analyses satisfaction and performance data to identify improvement levers | "Current TP02 (Satisfaction with repairs) at 3.5/5. First-time-fix rate (78%) is primary driver. Improving to 85% would lift TP02 to estimated 4.0/5" |
| 8 | **Compliance Failure Prediction** | Forecasts compliance items at risk of expiry or breach | "12 overdue EICRs. If not completed before 31/03/2026, BS03 drops from 97.8% to 87.6%. Contractor has Thursday availability" |

## Yantra Assist

Beyond the 8 models, every screen in SocialHomes.Ai features **Yantra Assist** — a contextual AI assistant that can:

- Draft tenant communications tailored to the case type, tenant history, and regulatory requirements
- Generate board-ready summaries from live data
- Explain compliance requirements in plain language
- Analyse trends and anomalies across the portfolio
- Answer natural language questions about operational data

---

# COMPLIANCE & AWAAB'S LAW

## Big 6 Compliance Dashboard

SocialHomes.Ai provides a single-view compliance dashboard covering all six key safety areas with real-time RAG status:

| Area | What Is Tracked |
|------|----------------|
| **Gas Safety** | CP12 certificate tracking, annual renewal management, expiry countdowns, contractor records |
| **Electrical Safety** | EICR compliance monitoring, 5-year inspection cycles, remedial action tracking |
| **Fire Safety** | Fire risk assessment schedules, alarm testing logs, Building Safety Act compliance |
| **Asbestos** | Asbestos register management, survey tracking, risk-rated action planning |
| **Legionella** | Water safety risk assessments, temperature monitoring, remedial action management |
| **Lift Safety** | LOLER compliance, insurance inspection scheduling, maintenance record tracking |

Each compliance area displays:
- Current compliance percentage (e.g., Gas 99.4%, Electrical 97.8%)
- Number of properties compliant vs total
- Expiring certificates with countdown
- Properties requiring attention flagged in red

## Awaab's Law — Built-In, Not Bolted On

Following the tragic death of Awaab Ishak and the subsequent legislation, SocialHomes.Ai has **real-time Awaab's Law compliance** built into the data model:

- **Emergency cases** (e.g., severe mould in bathroom and bedroom) carry a **24-hour countdown timer** displayed prominently on the case, the dashboard, and the daily briefing
- **Significant Hazard cases** track investigation and remediation deadlines in working days
- **Breach alerts** trigger automatically when deadlines are exceeded, with overdue counts displayed in red
- **Automated escalation** notifies managers and the compliance team when deadlines approach or are missed
- **Full audit trail** of every action, communication, and decision for regulatory and legal assurance

This is not a reporting feature — it is a **live operational tool** that ensures your frontline staff see deadline countdowns on every relevant screen, every day.

# 5-PERSONA SYSTEM: EVERYONE SEES WHAT THEY NEED

SocialHomes.Ai uses a role-based persona system that automatically scopes all data, KPIs, and AI insights to the user's level of responsibility. This is not simple permissions — it fundamentally changes what each user sees on every screen.

| Persona | Scope | What They See |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Chief Operating Officer** | Organisation-wide | Strategic KPIs, board-level dashboards, cross-portfolio analytics, regulatory risk overview, AI predictions across all areas |
| **Head of Housing** | Service Area | Regional performance, team workload distribution, service delivery metrics, escalation oversight, area-level compliance |
| **Team Manager** | Team | Team workload, officer caseloads, case assignment, performance monitoring, team-level KPIs |
| **Housing Officer** | Patch / Caseload | Patch-level tenant data, personal arrears worklist, case management, communication tools, daily briefing for their patch |
| **Operative** | Today's Jobs | Daily job list, property access details, work completion forms, scheduling, SOR codes for the day's repairs |

**Example**: When the COO opens the Dashboard, they see 12,847 properties across the organisation. When a Housing Officer opens the same Dashboard, they see the 45 properties in their patch. The interface is identical — the data is scoped.

| Reporting tools | £10,000–£20,000 additional | Included (30+ reports) |
| Annual IT support | £30,000–£60,000 | Self-hosted (own team) or discounted managed hosting |

**Additional efficiency gains from AI:**
- AI-prioritised arrears worklists reduce officer time spent on low-risk cases
- Predictive complaint alerts enable proactive resolution, reducing Ombudsman escalations
- Awaab's Law timers prevent statutory breaches and associated penalties/compensation
- Automated communication drafting reduces administrative time per case
- Daily AI briefings eliminate morning catch-up meetings and ad-hoc reporting

## Funding Strategy

Yantra.Works and 3C will work with grant funding bodies, including:
- **Innovate UK** — for AI and technology innovation funding
- **Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund** — where energy efficiency features align
- **PropTech Innovation Fund** — for housing technology development

Failing grant success, Yantra.Works will approach private investment. The consortium contribution structure is designed to remain viable regardless of external funding.

---

# GOVERNANCE & RISK MITIGATION

## Governance Structure

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Consortium Board** | Sets roadmap priorities, approves major decisions, resolves disputes. Meets monthly. |
| **Board Chair** | A Housing CEO from a member organisation. Rotating annually. |
| **Yantra.Works** | Standing Board member. Responsible for technology delivery, AI development, and platform maintenance. |
| **3C** | Standing Board member. Responsible for sector engagement, housing domain expertise, and implementation support. |
| **Senior Lead (per org)** | Decision-maker within each member organisation. Attends quarterly Board meetings. |
| **Success Champion (per org)** | Operational lead (not CEO) who drives internal adoption, provides feedback, and coordinates with the development team. Expected to commit 1–2 days per month. |

**Decision-making**: Roadmap priorities decided by majority vote. Each member has one vote. Yantra.Works and 3C have advisory (non-voting) standing.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Vendor dependency** | Code accessible via GitHub to all members. Self-hosting option with full documentation. No vendor lock-in. |
| **Data security** | UK-only data residency (Google Cloud, London). SOC 2 / ISO 27001 infrastructure. Cloud Armor WAF. Firebase Authentication. Full audit logging. |
| **Consortium disagreements** | Governance framework with Board Chair and majority voting. Standardised SOPs agreed at outset. |
| **Delivery delay** | Phased approach with working prototype already demonstrated. Agentic AI development enables faster iteration. Monthly Board reviews of progress. |
| **Data migration failure** | HACT v3.5 standard ensures interoperability. Parallel running period (minimum 3 months). Full rollback capability. |
| **Staff adoption** | Success Champion per organisation drives internal adoption. Role-based training (each persona trained separately). AI briefing makes the system immediately useful from day one. |
| **Regulatory changes** | Cloud-native architecture enables rapid updates. AI models can be retrained. Board sets priorities for regulatory response. |
| **Funding shortfall** | Consortium model spreads risk. Grant funding pursued in parallel. Contribution structure viable without grants. |

# FUTURE VISION

## Beyond the 18–24 Month Build

### Agentic AI Autonomy (Year 2+)
The AI models in SocialHomes.Ai are currently designed with a "human in the loop" — they recommend actions, but a person approves them. As the models prove their accuracy over 12+ months of real data, selected safe actions can be approved for autonomous execution:

- **Automated holding letters** sent when repairs exceed SLA targets
- **Automated payment plan offers** generated when UC transitions are detected
- **Automated escalation** of cases when deadlines approach
- **Automated welfare check scheduling** for silent vulnerable tenants

This has the potential to reduce administrative workload significantly while improving tenant satisfaction through faster response times.

### Collective Purchasing Power
Once SocialHomes.Ai is used by enough organisations, the consortium becomes large enough to negotiate collectively — not just for software, but for business services:

- **Tier 1 maintenance contractors**: Volume discounts currently only available to large providers
- **Insurance**: Group negotiation on building and liability insurance
- **Energy**: Collective energy procurement
- **Professional services**: Shared legal, compliance, and audit services

### Sustainable Growth
When the application attracts paying organisations beyond the founding consortium:

- Licence revenue funds continued development
- Founding members benefit from new features without additional capital outlay
- The product roadmap continues to be governed by the Board
- The platform becomes a sector-wide alternative to legacy vendors

### Integration Ecosystem
Future integrations planned:

- **Open Banking**: Real-time rent payment verification
- **DWP Universal Credit API**: Automated UC status and payment tracking

# APPENDIX 2: EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES

SocialHomes.Ai is designed to integrate publicly available data alongside organisation-specific data. The following external data sources are planned for integration:

| Data Source | Type | Use Case |
|-------------|------|----------|
| **Met Office DataPoint API** | Weather forecasts | Damp and mould risk prediction. Alerts when heavy rain is forecast for properties with known damp issues. |
| **Census 2021 Data (ONS)** | Demographics | Area-level vulnerability profiling. Comparing internal vulnerability data with area deprivation indicators to identify gaps. |
| **Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)** | Socioeconomic | Risk scoring. Areas with high deprivation correlate with higher arrears, more repairs, and more vulnerability. |
| **Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)** | Energy efficiency | Property energy ratings. Imported to track retrofit needs and carbon targets. |
| **DWP Universal Credit API** | Benefits data | Real-time UC status verification. Automated tracking of managed payments and Alternative Payment Arrangements. |
| **Land Registry Price Paid Data** | Property values | Stock valuation reporting. Market comparison for asset management. |
| **Council Tax Records** | Occupancy data | Void verification. Cross-referencing internal void status with council tax records. |
| **Ordnance Survey OpenData** | Geographic | Mapping. Property location verification, boundary data, address matching. |
| **Companies House** | Business data | Contractor verification. Checking contractor registration, financial health, and insurance status. |
| **Housing Ombudsman Decisions** | Regulatory | Benchmarking. Analysing published decisions to identify risk patterns and sector trends. |
| **RSH Statistical Data Return** | Sector data | Benchmarking. Comparing organisational performance against sector averages. |
| **HACT Data Standard v3.5** | Industry standard | Interoperability. All import/export uses the UK Housing Data Standard for portability. |

This approach means the system can flag potential issues that no single data source would reveal. For example:

- **Vulnerability gap detection**: If IMD data shows an area has high elderly population but internal records show no vulnerability flags for residents in that area, the system flags this as a potential gap for investigation.
- **Weather-linked proactive maintenance**: Combining Met Office forecasts with building age, construction type, and damp history to predict which properties need preventive attention before problems escalate.
- **Arrears early warning**: Combining UC transition data with seasonal patterns and area deprivation scores to predict arrears trajectories 30–90 days ahead.
