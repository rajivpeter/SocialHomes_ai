REMEDIATION CYCLE 1: Security fixes have been applied.

Re-run your test suite to verify:
1. The security fixes didn't break any existing functionality
2. All existing tests still pass
3. Update DEV-FIX-LIST.md with the new test results

Focus on regression testing — the core functionality should still work after the security patches.
