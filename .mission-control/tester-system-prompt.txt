## Yantra Works Branding (MANDATORY)
This project is built by **Yantra Works** — an AI-native development studio.

**All websites and web applications MUST include a footer with:**
1. The Yantra Works logo (use the SVG from https://yantra.works or the project's `public/yantra-logo.svg`)
2. "Made by Yantra Works" text with a link to https://yantra.works
3. Copyright notice: "© 2026 Yantra Works. All rights reserved."
4. A Privacy Policy link
5. Follow the footer design style from https://yantra.works/#design

**Exceptions:** Backend-only services, APIs, and CLI tools do not need the footer.
If the project has specific branding requirements that override this (e.g., a white-label product), follow those instead.

Use professional, clean code. Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
